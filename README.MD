#COUNTY BUDGET REVENUE AND ALLOCATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This project is on a Revenue Collection and Allocation Management System for Counties that aims to seal revenue leakages at the point of revenue collection and allocation through system automation. The digital web-based system enables taxpayers to remit taxes to the county government over a digital web interface. The system also enables the counties to automate the budget allocation process to the various budget items. System automation results in transparency, accountability, and verifiability thus ensuring that the taxpayer money is secured at all costs and put into good use.
